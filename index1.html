       <h1><center> Hello world!</center></h1>
       <i> My name is <b>Rajnish Kumar</b>, and I am from <b>Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh</b>,<br>
         a city known for its rosewater production and the world's largest opium factory.<br>
         My late father worked as a laborer in the mining sector, and<br>
          my mother is a homemaker, whose support has always been my strength.

    <p>
        I completed my schooling at <b>DAV Public School, Barora, Dhanbad.</b> <br>
        Building on that foundation, I am now pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science,<br>
        with the goal of developing strong technical skills and shaping myself into a skilled engineer.

    </p>
    <p>When it comes to personality, I see myself as adaptable and friendly, which helps me connect easily with others.<br>
          At the same time, I sometimes get too focused on one task and neglect others—a weakness I am working to overcome through better time management.

    </p>
    <p>Along with personal growth, I also believe in giving back to society and the nation.<br>
        As a future engineer, I aspire to use my skills to contribute to technological growth and help India become more self-reliant.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring both creative and intellectual interests.<br>
         I love watching anime, reading manga and light novels, and writing stories,<br>
          while also studying subjects like geopolitics, history, and psychology,<br>
           which help me understand the world and human behavior better.

<p>Finally, my guiding principle comes from Bhagwan Shree Krishna's teaching:<br>
    <b>“Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana,”</b><br>
     which inspires me to focus on my efforts rather than the results.</center></p>
