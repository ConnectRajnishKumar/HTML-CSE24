            <p>Gather Up All of the Crew,<br>
It's Time to Ship out Bink's Brew.<br>
Sea wing blows, to where who knows<br>
The waves will be our Guide<br>
O're across the ocean's tide<br>
Rays of sunshine far and wide<br>
Birds they sing of cheerful things,<br>
In Circles Passing by<br>
Bid fare well to weaver's town<br>
Say so long to port renownd<br>
Sing a song, it won't be long<br>
Before we're casting off!<br>
'Cross the Gold and silver seas,<br>
The Salty spray puts us at ease<br>
Day and night, to our delight,<br>
The Voyage never ends</p><br>
<hr>
Gather up all of the crew,<br>
it's time to ship out Bink's Brew<br>
Pirates we eternally,<br>
are challenging the sea!<br>
With the waves to rest our heads,<br>
Ship Beneith us as our beds<br>
Way up high upon the mast,<br>
Our Jolly Rodger flies!<br>
<hr>
Somewhere in the endless sky,<br>
Stormy winds are blowing by.<br>
Waves are dancing evening comes,<br>
It's time to sound the drums.<br>
But steady men and never fear,<br>
tomorrow's skies are always clear<br>
So pound your feet and clap your hands,<br>
'Till suny days return!<br>
Yohohoho! Yohohoho!<br>
<hr>
Gather up all of the crew.<br>
It's time to ship out bink's brew.<br>
Wave goodbye, but don't you cry,<br>
Our memories remain!<br>
Our days are but a passing dream.<br>
Everlasting though they seem.<br>
'Neith the moon we'll meet again,<br>
the winds out lullaby<br>
Gather Up all of the crew,<br>
It's time to ship out bink's brew.<br>
Sing a song and play along,<br>
For all the ocean's wide!<br>
After all is sead and done,<br>
You'll end up a skeleton,<br>
So spread your tail from dawn 'till dusk<br>
Upon these foamy Seas<br>

Yohohoho! Yohohoho!</p><hr>
